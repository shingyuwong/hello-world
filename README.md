Getting started with Github!

Copied and pasted text: "On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why." from https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/.
